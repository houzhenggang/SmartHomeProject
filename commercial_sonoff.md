# Sonoff
This Project is working with the sonoff relay modules, too. It can be flashed via the 5 pin header which are connected to VCC, TX, RX, GND and GPIO14.
To boot the sonoff in flashing mode hold the Button down when powering the board, since it is connected to GPIO0.

The ESP is connected to 1 button (GPIO 0), 1 relay (GPIO 12) and the green part of the Duo-LED(GPIO 13). And (GPIO 14) is routed to the fifth pin of the headers for flashing.
